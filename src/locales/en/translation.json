    "description": "In March 2024, I decided to take on the challenge of the Marathon des Sables, known as the 'world's toughest race,' without any prior marathon experience. With support from many people, I am preparing for a year to complete the race in April 2025. Due to the seemingly reckless nature and extreme difficulty of this challenge, we named this project 'Sahara Sabaka'.",
